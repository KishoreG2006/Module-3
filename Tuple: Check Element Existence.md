# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

##  Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

##Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

##  Program
~~~
x=("s", 8, "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e") 
print("n" in x) 
print(8 in x)
~~~
## Output
![438872848-214960c7-1781-4bdf-9275-83d0c4fd3645](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe53c9cb-34af-487e-bec6-ee8a2fc0d515)

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
