# EXP-3 List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

##  Program
~~~
L=[153,147,124,102] 
print(sum(L)))
~~~

## Output
![438861319-260b8c26-62f7-4a9e-9c89-0cabbb7be28d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a863349a-08b6-442f-95cc-607c5241e269)

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
